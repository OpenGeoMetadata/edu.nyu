    "This polygon shapefile represents basic population and housing characteristics for populated places (ADM5) in Panama, collected as part of its Censos Nacionales de 2010 by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censo. This layer was derived from a geodatabase (see the related data file) and was documented and restructured by East View Cartographic, Inc. Indicators in this layer include housing type (i.e. apartment, individual house etc.), size (as reflected in the number of rooms), building materials, and facilities and amenities (i.e. internet connection, availability of air-conditioning etc.). The census data collection provides indicators across five distinct subject categories (for two distinct administrative geographies), and contains 13,124 polygons and 1,188 attribute variables. Attribute descriptions retain original language names and unique identifier codes. All variable names were translated from Spanish. Field name prefixes, originally written with coded titles, were renamed to create unique names (e.g. Original variable of “Sexo: Hombre” was updated to BT_D001 and given the alias “Sex: Man[Sexo: Hombre]”, the letter D was given as it relates to the Demographic theme table. D = Demographic, E = Economic, H = Housing, M = Migration and S = Social. BT relates to the Barrios and LP relates to the populated places). All variables from the original data were reviewed for completeness and organized into their relevant themes of Demographic, Economic, Housing, Migration and Social. In the attribute tables, all geographic names and codes are represented as text fields and census data are represented as doubles or long integers. Automated tools were run to apply aliases in the format “English translation field description[original language field description]”. Vector data was analyzed for accuracy and compared with national boundaries. This layer is part of a partnership project with East View Cartographic and IPUMS International, titled the Global Census Archive. Refer to the metadata and documentation for original and translated codebooks and methodology."
