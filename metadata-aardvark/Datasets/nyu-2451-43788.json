The following process was used when preparing the MVA:1. Take all of the data layers and geocode to Census block groups.2. Inspect and validate those data layers.3. Using a statistical cluster analysis, identify areas that share a common constellation of characteristics.4. Map the result.5. Visually inspect areas of the City for conformity with the statistical/spatial representation.6. Re-solve and re-inspect until we achieve an accurate representation.
