    "dct_description_sm": ["This rapid response surveillance project was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to collect \"perishable\" data on egress behaviors and neighborhood conditions surrounding healthcare centers (HCCs) in New York City (NYC) during the initial NYC COVID-19 PAUSE ordinance from March 22nd to May 19th, 2020.  Anonymized data on NYC HCC egress behaviors were collected by observational field workers using a phone-based mapping application.  Each egress trip record includes the day of week, time of day, destination category type, along with an array of behavioral outcome categories, ambient weather conditions and socio-economic factors.  Egress trajectories with precise estimates of distance traveled and the spatial dispersion or \"spread\" around each HCC were added via post-processing.  The data collection and cleaning process resulted in 5,030 individual egress records from 18 facilities."],
